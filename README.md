## 😍 **What is a To-Do List?**
Imagine having a magical notebook! ✨  
- You can write down anything you need (homework, a game you want to play, or even cleaning your room!).  
- Everything you write stays safe and doesn’t disappear, even if you close the browser! 💾  

**With this app, you can:**
1. **Add tasks** you want to complete.
2. **Edit tasks** if you change your mind.
3. **Mark tasks as done (✔)** when you finish them.
4. **Delete all tasks** if you want to start fresh.

## 🚀 **How to Use the App?**
1. Open the page, and you'll see:
   - A text box to write your task ✍️.
   - An "Add" button to add tasks.
2. **To edit a task**: Click on the task name.
3. **To complete a task**: Check the box (✔) next to it.
4. **To delete all tasks**: Click the "Delete All" button.
